    <h3>Business Analytics Guiding Principles</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Data transformation should be performed as close to the source as possible, and as close to the user as necessary.</li>
      <li>Process is king. Technology change that does not enable process improvement does not move the organization forward.</li>
      <li>Dashboards, metrics, and KPIs that are not actionable exist only to serve the vanity of business leaders.</li>
      <li>Data science = experimentation; data technology = data science operationalized for business value delivery.</li>
      <li>Effective data and analytics leadership are skilled at closing the gap between strategy and execution.</li>
    </ol>
